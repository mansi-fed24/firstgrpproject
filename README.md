Exercise #8 - DOM + Inputs
Create a to-do list. The user should be able to fill in a text field with something the person needs to do (washing dishes, cleaning, buying cat food, etc.). The user should then be able to click a button to add the case to a To-Do list.

(Extra/Hard) Can you set a maximum limit of five items on your to-do list? Test!

(Extra/Hard) When the user creates a case, a button to delete the case should also be created next to it. When users click the button, the issue should be removed from the To-Do list.


Create a simple calculator. There should be two input fields that each enter a number, and when the user has filled in both and clicks on a button, these two values should be added to each other (+). Show the result in the DOM.

Create another button to multiply these numbers with each other.
Create a button to subtract these numbers with each other (number1 - number2). If the result is less than 0, print out a nice error message in the browser, where it is clear what the user has done wrong and needs to be corrected to make it work.

Have the user enter a number between 0-10 in an input field. If the number is less than 4, color it red. If it is between 4-7, color the number yellow. If the number is above 7, color it green. If the number is above 11 or below 0, print out an error message describing what the user has done wrong (i.e. if the number is too big/small).
